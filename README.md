# Java - Currency Exchange Application

Description: 
This GitHub repository hosts a Java-based Currency Exchange Application. This application provides users with a convenient way to check exchange rates and perform currency conversions between various major currencies, including USD, EUR, JPY, AUD, and GBP.

The application is designed with a user-friendly command-line interface (CLI) that guides users through the process of checking exchange rates and exchanging currencies. It allows users to set their default currency, check real-time exchange rates for their chosen currency, and perform currency conversions with ease.

Key Features:

    Dashboard: Users are presented with a dashboard that offers three main options:
        Check exchange rates
        Exchange currency
        Exit the program

    Check Exchange Rates: Users can view exchange rates for their default currency. They can
    also change their default currency to one of the supported options (USD, EUR, JPY, AUD) 
    and immediately see updated exchange rates.

    Exchange Currency: Users can select their current currency and the desired currency 
    for conversion. The application then calculates and displays the converted amount.

    Currency Support: The application supports five major currencies (USD, EUR, JPY, AUD, GBP) 
    and provides accurate exchange rate information for each pair.

    Error Handling: The application includes robust error handling to ensure that users 
    receive clear instructions and feedback in case of invalid inputs or unsupported currency selections.
